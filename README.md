# Food Items - Sales Predictions.


Hello Everyone! My name is Julian Arroyave at the moment of this project realization, 
I am a student at the Coding Dojo Data Science and Analytics bootcamp.

This right here will be a Sales Prediction Data Base analysis for food items sold at various stores.
The subject of this project is to help the retailer understand the properties 
of products and outlets that play crucial roles in predicting sales.

I will also present visualizations for a better understanding of the outcomes.

So, lets jump right in!.

AVERAGE VISIBILITY VISUALIZATION:

- As shown in the image above, the average visibility of the breakfast items is the higher one
of all items on this data collected.
- While the Health and Hygiene falls below 50%, being the last one on this list.

AVERAGE SALES PER ITEM TYPE:

- Here we have an overview of the average sales per item grouped by the outlet sales presented on the data collected

- From the previous visualization we can conclude the baking good are the ones with the lower average sales on the outlets, while the starchy foods and  the seafood are the one leading the sales.
- Even though there are some items that are not performing as good as the top ones, we can observe a tendency to have a very near performance on the sales for each category.

DECISION ON MODEL FOR PREDICTING SALES BASED ON ITEM CHARACTERISTICS

I analyzed a couple of ways to predict the sales of Items based on their characteristics. And while both were a great way to help us understand where we stand, the conclusion is to use the linear regression model, as it gave better results when evaluating its performance.

CONCLUSIONS

- Even though the Breakfast Items have the highest average visibility at the outlet locations, it still doesn’t perform well when it comes to sales. So, it brings up the question: Which better marketing strategies can we use as a company to improve sales? Maybe Promote Bakery Items on sale at the Counter/Cashier stands?
- As we could see on the AVERAGE VISIBILITY image, The Household items don’t have a high average visibility at the Outlet locations, but this doesn’t affect the sales. The trend and pattern analysis on sale shows a fairly good performance without having to invest a lot on marketing strategies or visibility accommodation.
